# Wordle-CE
A clone of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) made for the TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator. This is my first time using a low level language, and my first time making something for my calculator.

## How to install on a calculator
*This only works on the TI-84 Plus CE Graphing calculator!*

### Downloading
To install wordle, first download `WORDLE.8xp`. You can find the download on the right hand side, in the [Releases](https://github.com/MaximilianMcC/wordle-ce/releases/tag/1.0) tab. You also must download **TI Connect CE**.

### Installing/Putting on the calculator
Plug in your calculator to your computer via the mini usb b. Once connected, open TI Connect and navigate to the second option on the left. Hit the button with the upwards arrow, then select `WORDLE.8xp`. After that, press send and you're done.

### Launching on the calculator
On your calculator, press `prgm`, then find `WORDLE`. After that, hover over it and press `enter`, or press the number/letter next to it. To exit, press `clear`.
