# Wordle-CE
A clone of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) made for the TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator. This is my first time using a low level language, and my first time making something for my calculator.

There are currently a list of 2000 words that are used by the official New York Times Wordle game.

# TODO:
- [ ] Fancy word flipping animation thingy
- [ ] Make different word "packs" to download
- [ ] Don't show duplicated letters in word
- [ ] Animated notifications that fly in/out smoothly.
